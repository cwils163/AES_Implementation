#### AES Project
Name: Constance Wilson

##### How to Compile Code
Use the command 'make' to compile code and then the command './AES' to run the code. To run a test that compares the output of my code to 'appendix_c.txt' use the command 'make test'.

##### Resources
I used the FIPS document and lectures from class to write my code.

##### Appendix C Test Cases
My code doesn't fail any of the test cases.
